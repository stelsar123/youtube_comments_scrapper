# How to use:
In order to use this script you need two basic parameters. Firstly, you need to register to google developers and get an API Key for the youtube V3 API. You can follow the instruction given on the [official guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started). Then, you need the target channel's ID. Insert these two values in the config.json file. You can then configure the name of the output .json file and the speed parameter. Run and have fun scrapping!!!
